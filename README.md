# dog-breed-classifier

The CNN classifier is designed with Keras ResNet50V2 as base model and custom output layer.

Data is obtained from Kaggle.com 

Out of 120 types of breed available this classifier is designed to detect 10 breeds with accuracy of 70%.

The same model when trained to detect all 120 breeds gives accuracy of 30% only.

#NOTE: Both models were trained only for 300 epochs only. Training on more epochs will increase accuracy.
